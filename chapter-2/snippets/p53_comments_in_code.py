# Let's calculate the area of a circle
radius = 5
area = 3.14 * radius ** 2

# Determine if we have enough treats
treats = 5
cats = 2
# Each cat needs at least 3 treats
enough_treats = treats >= cats * 3 # Evaluates to False
# Comment explaining the calculation
# If enough_treats is True, we have sufficient treats
