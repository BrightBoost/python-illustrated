# Solution exercises chapter 1

## 1.1 Getting familiar with VS Code

### Creating the main folder
- Open VS Code.
- From the menu, choose **File Open Folder**
- Select the location on your computer where you want to keep the exercises, and create a new folder named `python-illustrated`.
- Open this newly created folder in VS Code.

### Creating the first subfolder
- In the Explorer (the left sidebar), right-click the empty space below your project name.
- Select **New Folder** and type `chatper-1`.
- Hit Enter.

Alternatively, click the folder-plus icon (at the top, right next to the main folder name), with the desired location selected.

### Renaming the folder
Right-click the folder `chapter-1` and choose **Rename**. Then type the correct name: `chapter-1`, and press Enter.

### Creating another subfolder
You don’t want to accidentally create this folder inside `chapter-1`. To avoid that, first make sure the `python-illustrated` folder is selected. You can tell it’s selected when the entire Explorer panel on the left has a blue border. Then again, right-click, select **New Folder** (or click the folder-plus icon at the top), name it `chapter-2` and hit Enter.

### Creating a Python file
- Right-click the `chapter-1` folder, select **New File**. Or, with the `chapter-1` folder selected, press the file-plus icon at the top right of the Explorer panel.
- Type `exercise1.py` and press Enter.

### Writing some code
- Click on `exercise1.py` to open it.
- Paste or type the line:

```python
print("Hey, I can create folders and files in VS Code!")
```
