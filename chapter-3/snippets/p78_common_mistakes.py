# Remember = is for assignment and == for comparison
a = 5
if a == 5:
    print("a is 5")


if a == 5:
print("a is 5")
# This will cause an IndentationError


# Fix:
if a == 5:
    print("a is 5")


if a == 5
    print("a is 5")
# Syntax error because of missing colon


# Fix:
if a == 5:
    print("a is 5")
