Dear Wiesje,
 
You can be stubborn, a little cynical, and sometimes you act like you run the place. But honestly, I love you just the way you are. Your little grumbles and loud barks are what make you so special.
You’re also doing an amazing job learning how to code! I'm so proud of how far you’ve come. You might not get it all yet, but you’re getting better every day, and that’s all that matters.
Keep being you, Wiesje. Don't change a thing.
 
With love,
 
Zia
